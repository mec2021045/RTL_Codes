## Counter
I successfully designed an up counter and updown counetr using Verilog as part of RTL Code. Counter is a sequential digital circuit that upcounter counts upward from a given starting point and Upcounter and Updown counter count can act as up and down counter and is commonly used in applications such as timing, control, and measurement systems.
In my implementation, I used behavioural modelling to define the functionality of the up counter and updown counetr. The counter takes in an input signal which, on every clock cycle, increments the count value. I also included a reset input to allow the counter to be initialized to a specific value.
To verify the functionality of the up counter, I designed and ran a test bench in Verilog, which simulated the counter's behaviour over several clock cycles. Through this process, I was able to ensure that the counter was counting correctly and accurately tracking the input signal.
